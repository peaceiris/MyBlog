      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m watching the AVP tour, especially (as always) Karch{.}. This year is his last and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to go and see him as much as I can. Karch is an idol for my generation of beach volley players. Well, it is an idol for all generations really
He loses one, he wins one. The day is about to end but he still has to play against Lambo. The sun is going down, it is the last match of the day.</description>

      <description>I used to play a lot, back in Italy. We would come out from work, go to the beach, play two or three hours, swim a bit and then go out for the night. This would happen about every day. We took it awfully seriously. We would go to the Italian national championships and all. It was quite a big deal.
Seattle, on the other hand, is not too conductive to beach volley.</description>
