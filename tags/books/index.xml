      <description>When I read Built to Last, In search of excellent and Good to great I immediately thought: What a bunch of BS!!. But again, I think that about most business books.
The content of these books seemed particularly ludicrous to me. I found both logical inconsistencies and methodological flaws in their process. For example, picking successful companies after the fact is analogous to picking the winners of a lottery and claim that they have exceptional skills.</description>

      <description>We get plenty of emails in Microsoft. Without a system to manage them you are dead. Or better, your mind plays strange tricks on you making you think that you still have work to do. You need to convince your mind that you are done for the day and to stop bugging you, please.
Almost everyone has a system. Some are better than others. My current system is Getting things done and it does achieve its goal of freeing my mind (mostly) without imposing too much overhead.</description>

      <description>Interesting read on what open source has been good for, on the difference between Linux and Wikipedia and on how to best harness the power of crowds.
Also a highly positively reviewed new book that formalizes in almost mathematical fashion what diversity is good for (I haven’t read it yet). The classical work on the matter is “The Wisdom of crowds”.
Excerpt from the initial article: “Raymond was clear on that point when, toward the end of his paper, he examined some of the “necessary preconditions” for the bazaar model of production.</description>

      <description>When I came to US, I wanted to get an introduction on personal finance. I needed to know what to insure, when, how to buy an house and all this sort of basic things. At the time I read Personal Finance for Dummies. I then discovered that very many US folks don’t know about these things either and I found myself recommending this simple book to plenty of people. You can find it for a few bucks in used book-stores.</description>

      <description>This is a book about Catalysis, an OO methodology. I read this book some time ago (like years). It is a quite complex book. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like methodologists, it will easily put you to sleep. But if you stay awake, it is worth it.
It is strange how this book crystallized one concept for me: the definition of an interface. An interface is not just the sum of the signatures of the methods.</description>

      <description>My wife and I are planning to move somewhere where you can walk to shops and restaurants. We were thinking about selling or renting our current suburbia home. So, as usual, I picked up a bunch of books from the local library. This is one of them. Amazon reviews are&amp;nbsp;here. &amp;nbsp; My opinion on the book The author did a good job of providing numeric evidence of the possibility of a real estate bubble.</description>
