 Part I – Background Part II – A simple example – modeling Maia  The previous post ended on this note.
let MaiaJointProb attitude action = match attitude with | Happy -&amp;gt; happyActions |&amp;gt; List.assoc action | UnHappy -&amp;gt; unHappyActions |&amp;gt; List.assoc action | Quiet -&amp;gt; quietActions |&amp;gt; List.assoc action This is just a two by two matrix. It simply represents which probability is associated to an (attitude, action) tuple.</description>

 Part I - Background Part IIb - Finding Maia underlying attitude   Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a simple example: inferring the underlying attitude of a small baby by observing her actions. Let&amp;rsquo;s call this particular small baby Maia. People always asks her father if she is a ‘good&amp;rsquo; baby or not. Her father started to wonder how he can possibly know that. Being ‘good&amp;rsquo; is not very clear, so he chooses to answer the related question if her attitude is generally happy, unhappy or simply quiet (a kind of middle ground).</description>

   Part IIa - A simple example - modeling Maia     Part IIb - Finding Maia underlying attitude    My interest in Bayesian inference comes from my dissatisfaction with ‘classical&amp;rsquo; statistics. Whenever I want to know something, for example the probability that an unknown parameter is between two values, ‘classical&amp;rsquo; statistics seems to answer a different and more convoluted question.
Try asking someone what the 95% confidence interval for X is (x1, x2) means.</description>
